This metapackage contains four packages:

* [**rtt\_controllers**](rtt_controllers) Basic controllers for serail manipulators. PID task space, PID joint space, computed torque joint space, operational space formulation.

* [**rtt\_trajectory\_generators**](rtt_trajectory_generators) Orocos KDL based cartesian trajectory generator, joint space velocity profiles, random waypoint publishers.

* [**rtt\_gazebo\_interface**](rtt_gazebo_interface) Connect to Gazebo from an Orocos component. Allows sending torque commands and reading joint states.

* [**rtt\_tools**](rtt_tools) Convenience functions for setting up controllers.
